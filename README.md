# What is Rockstor?

Rockstor is a Network Attached Storage(NAS) solution based on Linux and B-Tree
Filesystem(BTRFS). It is written in Python and Javascript, and is made
available as a complete Linux distribution for convenience. Rockstor takes NAS
to a new level with advanced features, ease of use and management. It goes
beyond NAS by supporting Docker based apps, RESTful APIs and serves as a
powerful cloud storage platform in a box.

# What are the project goals?

The main goal is to develop the ultimate open source NAS solution that anyone can
simply deploy on commodity hardware, use it easily and not be restricted in any
way. For more information, read the [team's
mission](http://rockstor.com/about-us.html).

# Who should use it?

Rockstor can be used by consumers and organizations, both big and small. As of
the current release, it's intended for advanced home users, DIY NAS builders
and smaller organizations that need NAS or private cloud in a box. Go to
[rockstor.com](http://rockstor.com) for more information.
